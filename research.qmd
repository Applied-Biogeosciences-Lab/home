We are collaborating with Michigan State University Upper Peninsula Research & Extension Center ([MSU-UPREC](https://www.canr.msu.edu/uprc/)) and [Full Plate Farm](https://www.fullplatefarmmi.com/) to examine implications of soil conservation and cover crop management practices on soil health, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), soil temperature & moisture, weed occurrence and organic vegetable crop production.

* NMU-ABL undergraduate research assistants recently presented their research at the 2024 Marbleseed Organic Farming Conference (La Crosse, WI), where NMU-ABL members also contributed toward the Organic University Sesssion “Climate Adaptation for Midwest Organic Vegetable Growers” facilitated by a team of researchers from UW-Madison.

## Heavy Metal Testing

We are collaborating with [Dr. Philip Yanguoru](https://nmu.edu/chemistry/dr-philip-yangyuoru) (NMU-Chemistry) to evaluate heavy metal concentrations among conventional, organic and not-certified organic fruit and vegetable production methods to examine the consumer health implications.  This pilot-study is intended to directly inform future research activities where we plan to use inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometery (ICP-MS) methods to examine linkages between heavy metal concentrations in produce with soil, water and crop production management methods.

* NMU-ABL undergraduate research assistants recently presented their research at the 2023 American Chemical Society Regional Chapter Meeting (Marquette, MI), and we are currently also examining heavy metal concentrations among beer styles, container types and production scales.

## Mitigation Wetlands

NMU-ABL has been collaborating with the Marquette County Conservation District and the City of Marquette to monitor hydrological and vegetation conditions within five mitigation wetlands.  A variety of measurement and monitoring methods, including implementing groundwater & meteorological data loggers, collecting herbaceous and woody vegetation surveys, and using UAV for LiDAR mapping have been performed since 2017 to contribute to ongoing assessment activities. 

* Several NMU-ABL researchers have presented their research at conferences such as the Society of Wetland Scientists and American Association of Geographers meetings where past topics included integrating aerial survey & hydrological monitoring data, evaluating the growth and survival of planted tree species, assessing vegetation composition and interannual trends, and examining hydrological connectivity between the mitigation wetlands with surrounding groundwater, Lake Superior and the atmosphere.

## Black Ash Wetlands & Forest Resources

As a part of an interdisciplinary team of scientists and resource managers, NMU-ABL personnel have contributed toward a long-term black ash forest resource management investigation in collaboration with the U.S. Forest Service and Michigan Technological University.  Major outcomes of this research have provided critical guidance and recommendations to forest resource managers throughout the Great Lakes region to help mitigate emerald ash borer (EAB) related disturbances.

Applied research activities included evaluating the growth and survival of alternative planted tree seedlings, predicting future black ash ecosystem conditions to examine species tolerances and produce climate adapted species recommendations, evaluating responses of nitrogen cycling, greenhouse gas emission and wetland water levels to simulated EAB disturbances to provide forest resource management guidance.
