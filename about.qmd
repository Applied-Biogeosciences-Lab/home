:::

We are collaborating with Michigan State University Upper Peninsula Research & Extension Center (Chatham, MI) and Full Plate Farm (Skandia, MI) to examine implications of soil conservation practices on soil health, greenhouse gas emissions, soil temperature & moisture, weed occurrence and organic vegetable crop production.

* NMU-ABL undergraduate research assistants recently presented their research at the 2024 Marbleseed Organic Farming Conference (La Crosse, WI), where NMU-ABL members also contributed toward the Organic University Sesssion “Climate Adaptation for Midwest Organic Vegetable Growers” facilitated by a team of researchers from UW-Madison.

:::

We are collaborating with Philip Yanguoru (NMU-Chemistry) to evaluate heavy metal concentrations among conventional, organic and not-certified organic fruit and vegetable production methods to examine the consumer health implications.  This pilot-study is intended to directly inform future research activities where we plan to use inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometery (ICP-MS) methods to examine linkages between heavy metal concentrations in produce with soil and water management conditions and also with pesticide and herbicide applications.

* NMU-ABL undergraduate research assistants recently presented their research at the 2023 American Chemical Society Regional Chapter Meeting (Marquette, MI).
