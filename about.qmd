We are collaborating with Michigan State University Upper Peninsula Research & Extension Center (Chatham, MI) and Full Plate Farm (Skandia, MI) to examine implications of soil conservation practices on soil health, greenhouse gas emissions, soil temperature & moisture, weed occurrence and organic vegetable crop production.

* NMU-ABL undergraduate research assistants recently presented their research at the 2024 Marbleseed Organic Farming Conference (La Crosse, WI), where NMU-ABL members also contributed toward the Organic University Sesssion “Climate Adaptation for Midwest Organic Vegetable Growers” facilitated by a team of researchers from UW-Madison.
